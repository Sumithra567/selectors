        <p>Shiva, also known as Siva, the Destroyer or the auspicious one, is one of the most important and best-known deities in Hinduism. He is venerated as the god of rebirth, destruction, benevolence and protection; and he is often revered as one of the deities in the Hindu trinity (trimurti). He is depicted as a half-naked man with several arms. In Shavism, he is regarded as the Supreme Being and creator.

            He has a third eye which he once used to incinerate the god of love Kama. Accordingly, he is also worshiped as the deity who destroys the universe every 2 or so billion years. Shiva is primarily associated with two deities Sati, the goddess of fertility; and Kali, the goddess of death.</p>

    <p>One of the most intriguing things about Shiva is how he’s depicted. He’s not just a one-dimensional figure; he’s a multi-faceted deity with various forms and symbols. For instance, you might see him as a meditating ascetic, deep in contemplation, or as Nataraja, the cosmic dancer whose movements symbolize the rhythm of the universe. Then there’s Danvantari, the nurturing healer, showing yet another side of Shiva’s complex personality.

        His iconography is equally rich. The third eye on his forehead? That’s a symbol of enlightenment and inner wisdom. The serpent Vasuki coiled around his neck? It represents mastery over desire. And the crescent moon on his head? That’s a nod to the passage of time and the inevitability of change. Each symbol tells a story, offering a glimpse into the deeper meanings behind Shiva’s role in the cosmos.</p>
